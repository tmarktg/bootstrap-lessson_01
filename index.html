          Why are you taking this course and what do you hope to get out of this
          course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to be able to build a portfolio to start applying for web
          developer jobs. Also, due to my low interaction with web developers
          because of online classes I've been taking at Mesa College, I want to
          gauge my skills as a developer to get an understanding of where my
          skill is compared to a group of students who are trying to become web
          developers. Further, I want to be able to meet a group of people to
          discuss their goals, and struggles and relate to them as I grow as a
          web developer. I hope to gain the necessary knowledge to build a
          protfolio to be able to get into a company and gain experience as a
          web developer. My goal for this course is to be able to present 5
          projects that would be practical to showcase my skills for front-end
          web development.

          What web design or web page design/development or any web creation
          tools, programming languages, digital imaging, print, drawing
          programs, or graphic creation experience do you have?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have been self-learning web development for close to a year. I have
          learnt HTML, CSS, and JS, and have some sense of image creation
          through canva. I also played around with some frameworks such as
          bootstrap, tailwindcss, and jQuery. I am also aware of photoshop and
          have seen some tutorials on how to use it. I haven't made any great
          strides in learning material, probably because I've been focusing too
          much on learning rather than doing. I find myself knowing how to do
          things but only after there are a series of steps for me to follow in
          order to do it.

        <h3>What hobbies do you enjoy doing on your free time?</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy boxing, and playing chess in my free time. I also love hiking,
          something about the fresh air and heights makes me happy, as it is a
          nice change of pace from sitting in front of a computer all day. My
          favorite hobby is probably watching anime and manga. I never really
          grew out of it and I love the prospect of maybe helping an author
          later down the road with my web development skills.
